# roadmap 

Hey Tunechi! ðŸ˜Š Awesome that youâ€™re diving into full-stack developmentâ€”exciting journey ahead! Starting with **frontend development** is generally considered a better and "easier" entry point, especially for beginners. Why? Because you can quickly see visual results, which is motivating. Itâ€™s also more intuitive to start with building the visible parts of a website before moving into the complex logic of backend systems.

Letâ€™s create a **detailed roadmap** for you, focusing on **frontend first**, then gradually transitioning to backend as you grow. Here's how we can break it down:
